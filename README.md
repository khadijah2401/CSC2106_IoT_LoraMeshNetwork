# LoRa Mesh Network with Encrypted Payload and ThingsBoard Integration

This project implements a scalable and secure IoT mesh network using Arduino nodes with LoRa radios. Sensor data is encrypted and transmitted across nodes and finally forwarded to The Things Network (TTN) via a Raspberry Pi bridge. Data is visualized in real-time on a ThingsBoard dashboard.

## üì° Project Overview

- Nodes use RH_RF95 for mesh communication.
- AES-128 encryption for secure payload transmission.
- Raspberry Pi acts as a serial bridge to TTN via LMIC uplink.
- TTN forwards data to ThingsBoard via webhook integration.
- PING-PONG downlink testing supported via TTN + ThingsBoard.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. Flash the respective `.ino` files to each node using Arduino IDE.
2. Set up Raspberry Pi to run `serial_script.py` for parsing mesh output.
3. Deploy WisGate and configure TTN with correct keys.
4. Use ThingsBoard Rule Chains to decode uplink, handle downlink, and visualize data.
5. Send `PING` from ThingsBoard Cloud Dashboard to test latency tracking and hop count.

- OTA firmware updates
- Larger queue with priority-based flushing
- Real-time geolocation with GPS shields
- Adaptive data rate (ADR) on LoRa
